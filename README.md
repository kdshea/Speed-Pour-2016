# üç∏ 2016 SpeedPour App

Welcome to SpeedPour! This project serves as an example of one of my early projects from 2016. It is a basic web application designed for bar managers to manage liquor inventory and set up ordering emails. It does not include any local storage capabilities and primarily focuses on the user interface and basic functionality. While the project is outdated and may not reflect my current skill level, I have decided to make it publicly available on GitHub to showcase my journey as a web designer and developer. Feel free to explore the code to get an understanding of my early work and the progress I have made over the years.


## ü™¥ About Me
As a full stack developer, I thrive on solving complex problems and building innovative solutions. With 7 years of experience with front end web development and one year of expertise with server-side programming and back end technologies, I'm well-equipped to tackle a wide range of development challenges and deliver end-to-end solutions. I have hands-on experience working on diverse projects, including web applications, RESTful APIs, and database management.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this old project and learn about my story. I am excited about the opportunity to demonstrate my growth and discuss my current skills and capabilities.

## üå± Background

I want to take a moment to share my journey as a web designer and developer. In the early years of my career, I primarily focused on front-end development and utilized my skills to make updates for the restaurant groups I worked for. This involved tasks such as modifying opening hours, updating photos, and managing menus. It provided me with valuable experience in working with real-world clients and understanding their specific needs.

In June 2021, I decided to take on a side hustle and started building static websites for local small businesses. This endeavor allowed me to further expand my skills and gain practical experience in developing websites from scratch. Despite managing restaurants at the same time, I dedicated my free time to crafting visually appealing and functional websites for my clients.

However, as I progressed in my career, I realized the importance of rounding out my skill set and gaining a deeper understanding of back-end development. To achieve this, I made the decision to enroll in a software engineering bootcamp that included comprehensive training in both front-end and back-end development. This experience provided me with the knowledge and hands-on practice needed to become a well-rounded web professional.

## üöÄ Future Plans

Now, I am fully focused on my freelance business, leveraging my enhanced skill set in both front-end and back-end development. I am excited to take on new challenges and work closely with clients to create engaging web experiences. Building on the lessons learned from this early SpeedPour App, I am committed to revisiting this project in the future and delivering a sophisticated and feature-rich application.
